# jwzsfml-header
This file is a conglomeration of generic SFML-related classes and utilities, lumped together for 
the purpose of easily experimenting with new coding and design concepts across multiple personal
projects. It has grown far beyond its original size; I may finally divide the classes out into 
separate headers, but it hasn't been an important priority for personal experiments.
